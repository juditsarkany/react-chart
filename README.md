## React App with Chart

**This web application was built with React JS.**

Using OpenWeather API, I showcase 8 day's max temperature in a chart. Current application shows the data for Amsterdam, and within local date.

**Used:**

- OpenWeather API
- Chart.js

**Roadmap**

- Add input for location
- Detect geolocation
- Showcase more data other than temperature
